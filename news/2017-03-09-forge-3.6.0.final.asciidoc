What's new and noteworthy? 
==========================

* *Faster addon development turnaround*: We've introduced an `addon-watch-start` command that watches the deployed addons with SNAPSHOT versions in your local maven repository and automatically redeploys them. Just `mvn clean install` your addon and it will be re-deployed. 

* *Component upgrades*: we have upgraded Roaster to 2.20.0.Final
